# Online Food Delivery System

The Online Food Delivery System is designed to provide convenience for customers by eliminating the drawbacks of traditional queueing systems. It allows users to order food hassle-free from restaurants and mess services. This system enhances the order-taking method by setting up an online food menu, enabling easy order placement and tracking. It includes a feedback system where users can rate food items and receive recommendations based on these ratings. Payments can be made online or through a pay-on-delivery option. For secure ordering, each user has a separate account with an ID and password.
