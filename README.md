# Online Food Delivery System

Online food delivery platform is designed to provide convenience for customers. It eliminates the drawbacks of traditional queueing systems by allowing users to order food hassle-free from restaurants and mess services. This system enhances the method of taking orders from customers by setting up an online food menu, enabling easy order placement and tracking. It also includes a feedback system where users can rate food items and receive recommendations based on these ratings. Payments can be made online or through a pay-on-delivery option. For secure ordering, each user has a separate account with an ID and password.
